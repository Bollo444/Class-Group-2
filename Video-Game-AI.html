        1970s: The Birth of Video Games
    </h2>
    <p>In the 1970s, video games were in their infancy. The first video game, "Computer Space," was released in 1971, but it was not a huge success. However, the 1970s saw the development of many other early video games, such as "Pong" (1972) and "Space Invaders" (1978). These games were simple and had limited graphics, but they laid the foundation for the video game industry.</p>

        This decade marked the true beginning of consumer video games. The AI implemented during this era was rudimentary but revolutionary. Games like Pong featured basic hard-coded logic, where the "opponent" was governed by simple, predetermined rules: move the paddle to intercept the ball. This fundamental concept—giving a machine agency—was the initial step toward complex modern AI.

        1980s: The Golden Age of Arcade Games
    </h2>
    <p>In the 1980s, video games became more popular and advanced. The introduction of home consoles like the Atari 2600 and the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) brought video games into living rooms. Games like "Pac-Man" (1980), "Donkey Kong" (1981), and "Super Mario Bros." (1985) became cultural phenomena. The 1980s also saw the rise of arcade games, with classics like "Street Fighter" (1987) and "Mortal Kombat" (1992) becoming iconic.</p>

    <p>
        With the rise of arcade cabinets and home consoles, AI progressed to include more sophisticated enemy patterns and behavior trees. Games like Pac-Man or early scrolling shooters introduced creatures that followed specific, scripted paths or reacted predictably to the player's presence. While still simple by today's standards, this era established the foundations for pathfinding and state machines—where a character changes behavior based on its current situation.

        1990s: The Rise of 3D Graphics
    </h2>
    <p>The 1990s marked a significant leap in video game technology with the introduction of 3D graphics. Games like "Super Mario 64" (1996) and "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time" (1998) revolutionized the industry by offering immersive 3D worlds. The PlayStation and Nintendo 64 consoles dominated the market, and online gaming began to take shape with the release of "Ultima Online" (1997).</p>

    <p>
        The transition to 3D environments presented new challenges and opportunities for AI developers. Characters could no longer be controlled by simple 2D patterns; they needed to navigate complex spatial geometry. This led to the development of sophisticated A* search algorithms for efficient pathfinding in 3D worlds. Early first-person shooters featured enemies that could hide, flank, and respond dynamically to the player's position, signaling a major leap in combat AI.

        2000s: The Era of Online Gaming
    </h2>
    <p>The 2000s saw the rise of online gaming, with games like "World of Warcraft" (2004) and "Halo 2" (2004) becoming massive multiplayer online (MMO) hits. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles introduced more advanced graphics and online capabilities. The 2000s also saw the rise of indie games, with titles like "Braid" (2008) and "Journey" (2012) gaining critical acclaim.</p>

    <p>
        The rise of massive multiplayer online games (MMOs) and increasingly powerful consoles demanded scalable and reliable AI. Developers focused on elaborate scripting systems to manage thousands of Non-Player Characters (NPCs), giving them schedules, dialogue trees, and rudimentary social interactions. In single-player RPGs, companion AI and improved enemy squad tactics became standard, making battles feel more tactical and less mechanical.

    <h2>
        2010s: The Age of Open Worlds
    </h2>
    <p>The 2010s brought the rise of open-world games, with titles like "The Last of Us" (2013), "Red Dead Redemptiion 2 (2018), and "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" (2015) offering vast, immersive worlds for players to explore. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles dominated the market, and online gaming continued to evolve with the rise of cloud gaming services like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Now.</p>

    <p>
        Open-world games became dominant, requiring AI systems that could manage vast, persistent environments. AI in this decade focused on creating emergent gameplay, where systems interacted to produce unscripted events. This included better civilian AI (simulated city traffic, daily routines) and adaptive difficulty, where the game AI subtly adjusts challenges based on the player's skill level to maintain engagement.

        2020s: The Future of Gaming
    </h2>
    <p>The 2020s are shaping up to be a decade of innovation and immersion in gaming. With the release of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, players can expect even more advanced graphics and faster load times. The rise of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is also set to revolutionize the gaming industry, with titles like "Half-Life: Alyx" (2020) and "Beat Saber" (2019) leading the way.</p>

    <p>
        The current decade is defined by the integration of cutting-edge technology into AI design. This includes using Machine Learning (ML) for true adaptive AI that learns player habits over time. Furthermore, Generative AI is beginning to be employed to procedurally create massive amounts of content, terrain, and even quests, offering unprecedented replayability and personalization in the gaming experience.
