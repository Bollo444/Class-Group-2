 <h1>History of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>The history of artificial intelligence (AI) is expansive and has effected multiple fields. From healthcare, technology, literature, culture, and the evolution of people, AI has had an impact. Its role is becoming more integral and elusive.  Its impact is great as it continues to evolve. The future of AI is presently unknown but its origin can be stemmed from 1726 in Jonathan Swift's novel, Gulliver's Travel. According to IBM, "Swift's fantastic novel...introduces the idea of The Engine, a large mechanical contraption used to assist scholars in generating new ideas, sentences and books" (IBM).
