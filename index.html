 <h1>History of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>The history of artificial intelligence (AI) is expansive and has effected multiple fields. From healthcare, technology, literature, culture, and the evolution of people, AI has had an impact. Its role is becoming more integral and elusive.  Its impact is great as it continues to evolve. The future of AI is presently unknown but its origin can be stemmed from 1726 in Jonathan Swift's novel, Gulliver's Travel. According to IBM, "Swift's fantastic novel...introduces the idea of The Engine, a large mechanical contraption used to assist scholars in generating new ideas, sentences and books" (IBM).

    <h2>History of AI</h2>
    <p>From Alan Turing’s 1948 “Intelligent Machinery” to GPT-3’s 175 billion parameters, AI has evolved from theory to transformative force. IBM notes that even Jonathan Swift’s 1726 novel *Gulliver’s Travels* imagined “The Engine,” a fictional machine to generate ideas.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="literature">
    <h2>AI in Literature</h2>
    <p>AI has long haunted and inspired fiction—from Samuel Butler’s *Erewhon* (1872) to HAL 9000 in *2001: A Space Odyssey*. These narratives reflect both utopian dreams and dystopian fears.</p>

    <h2>SWOT Analysis of AI</h2>
<img src="/SWOT Analysis of AI-pestleanalysis.gif" alt="AI SWOT Analysis" width="850" height="700">
<br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Speed, scalability, data processing, personalization</li>
      <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Bias, lack of transparency, high energy use</li>
      <li><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Healthcare, education, climate modeling, accessibility</li>
      <li><strong>Threats:</strong> Job displacement, misuse, ethical concerns, surveillance risks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AI’s power lies in its duality—both a tool for liberation and a force requiring stewardship.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="comparison">
    <h2>🏢 AI vs. Non-AI Companies</h2>
    <p><strong>AI-Driven Company:</strong> Vizit uses AI to predict content effectiveness, accelerating product development and customer engagement.</p>
    <p><strong>Non-AI Company:</strong> Many traditional firms still avoid AI due to lack of expertise or fear of disruption. These companies often lag in innovation and efficiency.</p>
    <p>Studies show AI adopters grow faster and report higher revenue gains than non-adopters.</p>
